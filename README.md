## About me
I am a developer driven by the urge to provide effective solutions to problems. During development, my goal is to deliver secure, scalable and robust applications.
I achieve this by taking into account the best architectural pattern, security practices and data storage mechanism. Given my passion and willingness to understand both sides of
the development stack, I have spent a considerable amount of time in perfecting my skills in Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot as well as ReactJs.
